<h2>Possible Strategies</h2>
<p>There are likely MANY more, here are just a few</p>
<h3>The Profiteer</h3>
<p>This is a really, really simple one. Just continually modify your manufaturing sliders to 
   ensure you're always making $1 than you're spending. This will make progress slow, but sure.</p>

<h3>The Investor</h3>
<p>This is a second-stage plan to the Profiteer - once you have a few $k, buy up close to all of
   one market, ensuring demand is adequately high. Then wait for the price to rise. SELL SELL SELL
   and enjoy your money.</p>
